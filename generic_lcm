**Number of Divisors for LCM(p,q) = r² × s³ × v²⁵**

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**
Given LCM in prime-factorized form:
LCM(p,q) = r² × s³ × v²⁵
Where:
- r, s, v are distinct prime factors
- Exponents: 2 (r), 3 (s), 25 (v)

**Step 2: Divisor Count Formula**
For any number n = p₁^e₁ × p₂^e₂ × ... × pₖ^eₖ:
Number of divisors = (e₁+1)(e₂+1)...(eₖ+1)

For LCM(p,q) = r² × s³ × v²⁵:
Number of divisors = (2+1)(3+1)(25+1) = 3 × 4 × 26 = 312

**Other Possible Cases:**

1. **Different Exponents**
   Example: LCM(p,q) = r⁵ × s¹ × v¹⁰
   Number of divisors = (5+1)(1+1)(10+1) = 6 × 2 × 11 = 132

2. **Additional Prime Factors**
   Example: LCM(p,q) = r² × s³ × v²⁵ × w¹
   Number of divisors = (2+1)(3+1)(25+1)(1+1) = 3 × 4 × 26 × 2 = 624

3. **Shared Prime Factors**
   If p = r² × s³ and q = r¹ × s⁴:
   LCM(p,q) = r² × s⁴
   Number of divisors = (2+1)(4+1) = 3 × 5 = 15

**Key Notes:**
- Works for any number of distinct primes
- Higher exponents increase divisor count significantly
- Example: LCM = 2² × 3³ × 5²⁵ would have 312 divisors (5²⁵ is ~30 digits)

**Final Answer:**
For LCM(p,q) = r² × s³ × v²⁵:
Number of distinct divisors = 312
