To calculate the **number of distinct divisors** of the LCM of two numbers \( p \) and \( q \) where \( \text{LCM}(p, q) = r^2 \times s^3 \), follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of the LCM**
The LCM is already given in its prime-factorized form:
\[
\text{LCM}(p, q) = r^2 \times s^3
\]
Here:
- \( r \) and \( s \) are **distinct primes**.
- The exponents are \( 2 \) (for \( r \)) and \( 3 \) (for \( s \)).

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Divisor Count Formula**
The number of distinct divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \dots \times p_k^{e_k} \) is:
\[
\text{Number of Divisors} = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \dots (e_k + 1).
\]
For \( \text{LCM}(p, q) = r^2 \times s^3 \):
\[
\text{Number of Divisors} = (2 + 1)(3 + 1) = 3 \times 4 = \boxed{12}.
\]

---

### **Step 3: List All Divisors (Optional)**
To verify, enumerate all combinations of exponents:
1. \( r^0 s^0 = 1 \)
2. \( r^0 s^1 = s \)
3. \( r^0 s^2 = s^2 \)
4. \( r^0 s^3 = s^3 \)
5. \( r^1 s^0 = r \)
6. \( r^1 s^1 = r s \)
7. \( r^1 s^2 = r s^2 \)
8. \( r^1 s^3 = r s^3 \)
9. \( r^2 s^0 = r^2 \)
10. \( r^2 s^1 = r^2 s \)
11. \( r^2 s^2 = r^2 s^2 \)
12. \( r^2 s^3 = r^2 s^3 \)

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Distinct Primes Matter**: The formula works because \( r \) and \( s \) are distinct primes.  
2. **Exponents Determine Count**: Each exponent \( e_i \) contributes \( (e_i + 1) \) choices for its power in a divisor.  
3. **Generalization**: For \( \text{LCM}(p, q) = r^a \times s^b \times t^c \), the number of divisors is \( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) \).

---

### **Example**
If \( \text{LCM}(p, q) = 2^2 \times 3^3 = 108 \), then:
\[
\text{Number of Divisors} = (2+1)(3+1) = 12.
\]
**Divisors of 108**:  
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 108.  

---

### **Final Answer**
The number of distinct divisors of \( \text{LCM}(p, q) = r^2 \times s^3 \) is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
