**Calculating the Number of Divisors for LCM(p,q) = r² × s³**

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of the LCM**
The LCM is given in prime-factorized form as:
LCM(p, q) = r² × s³
Where:
- r and s are distinct primes
- Exponents are 2 (for r) and 3 (for s)

**Step 2: Apply the Divisor Count Formula**
For any number n = p₁^e₁ × p₂^e₂ × ... × pₖ^eₖ, the number of distinct divisors is:
Number of Divisors = (e₁ + 1)(e₂ + 1)...(eₖ + 1)

For LCM(p, q) = r² × s³:
Number of Divisors = (2 + 1)(3 + 1) = 3 × 4 = 12

**Step 3: List of All Divisors (Optional Verification)**
1. r⁰s⁰ = 1
2. r⁰s¹ = s
3. r⁰s² = s²
4. r⁰s³ = s³
5. r¹s⁰ = r
6. r¹s¹ = r s
7. r¹s² = r s²
8. r¹s³ = r s³
9. r²s⁰ = r²
10. r²s¹ = r² s
11. r²s² = r² s²
12. r²s³ = r² s³

**Key Points:**
1. The formula works because r and s are distinct primes
2. Each exponent eᵢ contributes (eᵢ + 1) choices for its power in a divisor
3. General formula: For LCM(p,q) = rᵃ × sᵇ × tᶜ, number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)

**Example:**
If LCM(p,q) = 2² × 3³ = 108, then:
Number of Divisors = (2+1)(3+1) = 12
Divisors of 108: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 108

**Final Answer:**
The number of distinct divisors of LCM(p,q) = r² × s³ is: 12
